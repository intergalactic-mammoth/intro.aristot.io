# intro.aristot.io

A lightweight, minimal "about me" page I did because:
- My main website, https://aristot.io doesn't show up at Google search for "Aristotelis Economides". This one hopefully will.
- I don't want to keep the reading experience clean on https://aristot.io and not fill it with my social media accounts.

## Uses

- [@node](https://nodejs.org): module management
- [@tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation): fast and easy styling
- [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin): no-effort text layout
- [@fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/): icons
- [@typeitjs](https://www.typeitjs.com/docs/vanilla/): typing animation

## Notes to myself

### Setup

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography

npx tailwindcss init
```

### TODO

- setup GH Action for building Tailwind, fix project structure (`src/`)
